                    We are a team of 4 participating in Hack the Valley 5. <br/>
                For this hackathon, we developed a project that aims to <br/>
                help children gain a better understanding Covid-19. To do <br/> 
                this, we gave the information about covid in a child-friendly<br/>
                way, and also gave them a fun quiz to test their memory and <br/>
                strengthen their knowledge of Covid and its effects, so they <br/>
                can stay safe.
