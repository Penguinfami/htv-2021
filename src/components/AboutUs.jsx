                    Hi, we are Events Encapsulated, a team of 4 participating  <br/>
                    in Hack the Valley 5. For this hackathon, we developed a <br/>
                    project that aims to help children gain a better understanding <br/> 
                    of Covid-19. To do this, we gave the information about covid <br/>
                    in a child-friendly way, and also gave them a fun quiz to test <br/>
                    their memory and strengthen their knowledge of Covid and  <br/>
                    its effects, so they and their family can stay safe and healthy.
